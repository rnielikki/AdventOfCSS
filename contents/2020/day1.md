Look, there are some boxes.

Your first task is very simple: **Move all the piles of boxes in one row**.

There should not be empty space between boxes. **Keep all boxes dence** so Santa Claus can fill with more gifts!

Phew, there are lots of gifts.

You did it, then this is next step.

Make sure **the gifts in the same line**.

Here is the hint for you: the gift size is 300px, and the container size is 900px.

The gifts have border, but keep them. **Don't change gift size pixels manually**.

Use template from [here](contents/2020/html/day1.html) and edit only CSS.

## Result

## Rules

**Only use CSS 3+**. Editing template (both HTML and CSS) and using JavaScript are not allowed. Of course any image drawing outside CSS isn't allowed.

You can use stylesheet language that can converted into CSS (Sass, Less etc).
