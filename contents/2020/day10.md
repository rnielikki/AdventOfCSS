# Day 10

You found some decoration tools on your office table. And you found that this is the task for you.

"I didn't know the office is decorated." You said.

"No, we'll put it on the sledge", whispered a gnome, in the same office.

You found some paper mask seal for the decoration- "merry christmas" **in serif font**. You put it on the black acrylic plate, and **spray in rainbow color, from left to right**.

"Oh, I forgot one thing about this. **Capitalize the first letter.**" The coworker said.

Cut the text, and put on the rainbow spray.

Suddenly, some fun idea came on your mind. You found the word "CSS" in the text. You put **span** elements on them, **capitalize**, and **highlighted yellow with blur pen**. Now they glow beautifully.

Use template from [here](contents/2020/html/day10.html) and edit only CSS.

## Result

## Rules

**Only use CSS 3+**. Editing template (both HTML and CSS) and using JavaScript are not allowed. Of course any image drawing outside CSS isn't allowed.

**Don't use !important.**

You can use stylesheet language that can converted into CSS (Sass, Less etc).
