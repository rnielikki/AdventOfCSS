# Day 11

When you entered in the bathroom, there was an empty bath. You saw the clock, and it was almost gnomes' bath time.

I should **fill the water, but don't make overflow, naturally...**, You think.

---

You found a rubber duck, sinking in the bottom of the bath.

It's not natural, the rubber duck **must float on the water in any water height**.

**Also using variable with water height is prohibited in this bathroom**. The duck should float, relative to water.

Use template from [here](contents/2020/html/day11.html) and edit only CSS.

## Result

## Rules

**Only use CSS 3+**. Editing template (both HTML and CSS) and using JavaScript are not allowed. Of course any image drawing outside CSS isn't allowed.

**Don't use !important.**

You can use stylesheet language that can converted into CSS (Sass, Less etc).
