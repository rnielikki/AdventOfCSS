# Day 12

Some gnomes are decorating the Santa's house. You was curious, because you thought that the packaging and sending work was everything.

"We also have some visitors in Christmas", a gnome said, painting the wall.

"But this is 2020..."

"Shhh. Santa decided to do virtual meeting this year! And we, gnomes and Santa are not real human, so we cannot catch any virus."

The gnome is just giving you the some leaves for the Christmas tree.

"**Make three triangles, and make tree shape.** If you don't know how the Christmas tree shape looks like, it's **centered isosceles on pile, and they're connected so a point is hidden inside others**. Oh, I almost forgot, **The triangle should be bigger than upper triangle, if they have one**, so the tree can stand."

The gnome gone away. You think about the tree - It has **brown bottom part**. Of course they're **much smallar than leaves, but they're also short**.

The tree is done, but it does look like tree, not Christmas tree. You need to find bunch of decorations. First, let's find where is a star. **The yellow star shape (x2605) is on the top of the tree**. Also the **star shouldn't on the behind tree**. The star is **rotated 30 degrees** and **has orange border**.

Let's add some chain decorations. **Each triangle holds 1 decoration.** The decoration is **balls** and you can choose color. **The chain decoration is laid 15 degree**. Be careful, **don't change the height, the tree should't affected**, either **the decorations aren't behind tree**. It's okay that some decoration balls are outside tree, but not too much.
