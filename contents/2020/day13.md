# Day 13

The gnome is designing the room, but looks like it doesn't work well. You decided to help the work.

First thing that should be done is putting tiles on the floor.

"Whoa, look at these tiles! Is this bathroom or toilet?"

"No, it's a design!" Gnome replied.

**Put 40px teal square tiles on the floor**. Fill the gap with **10px yellowgreen**.

Now wallpapers are on your hand. You're still reading the designing plan:

**Walls are sandybrown and on the both side (left, right)**. **Center of the wall is color of burlywood and the celling is color of salmon**. You may want to use perspective and transition with it.

**Remember not to leak the papers outside (put just inside the black square)**. Also don't touch the black square. Also **every walls, floors and cellings should fit each other**.

"It was hard work, I'm sweating. I want to open the door... and window."

"But you dind't make the window!"

"Because the design never mentioned it!" You said, showing the paper.

"Oopsy... I forgot it. Sorry." And the gnome was gone. Now the task is yours, you should do the work.

**Open a window on the wall-center part**. The window **should be transparent** - faking with white square is not allowed.

Use template from [here](contents/2020/html/day13.html) and edit only CSS.
