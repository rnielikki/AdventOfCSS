# Day 14

A gnome was drawing a picture for christmas gift, but looks like its drawing skill is not so good. There are so many papers of failed images on the floor. You pick one, and say:

"This one is nice."

"But I failed, it looks still weird."

"Don't worry, I'll help you."

You check the image and find some problems:

* The clouds are not realistic. This can be solved by **making the clouds blur**.
* The leaves of the tree is not on the center. **Move the leaves to the center of the tree**.
* The house blocks are too red. **Add them gray to make brick color**.
* Where is the **roof**? Create as **Trapezoid shape**. You can use any color, but **upper width is same as its house width**. Of course, **they're on center too**.

"Looks nice now, isn't it?"

But the picture still need to touch. The sky is too dark, and the leaf has similar color as sky.

"I have an idea. Let's **add 50% sepia first. And make them 20% brighter and add 50% more contrast**", the gnome said.

Now only the one thing left - make gorgeous frames on it.

"**Use two colors, but don't touch the glass.**" The gnome said. "**I want the two-bordered frame.** Can you do this?"

Use template from [here](contents/2020/html/day14.html) and edit only CSS.
