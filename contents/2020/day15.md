# Day 15

On your table, there are stack of papers for letter.

"Many people, especially children send letter to Santa. Because the letter is too much, Santa cannot handle it alone. So we reply."

"But it's cheat..." "Shh." The gnome gave you a pencil.

"Also you can send reply on the letters."

"I don't want to.", You said.

"Fine. Then, make letter templates with these paper."

The gnome took a paper from the table.

You **turn paper letters to the gnome**. The gnome is on the **left**. The letter is big enough to understand, so **set letters to 30px**. But the contents should fit inside the letter, so **set text to semi-condensed**. Font is **Sans-serif**, line height is **1.5em**.

The letter's **size can be changed** like a magic to write longer contents.

The paper **has underline that the gaps exactly fit to letter size and line height**. Make sure that the **underlines work even if the font size changes**.

Use template from [here](contents/2020/html/day15.html) and edit only CSS.
