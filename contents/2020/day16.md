# Day 16

Working inside was warm and cozy, but smells like a new house. There are some paints, so you feel a bit dizzy. You went outside for refreshing.

You found some gnomes, playing on a flexible wall. They are side of the wall, when nothing happens. **By Clicking a mouse down to a gnome, it changes into smooth, round cyan light on the center. Every other gnomes after the hidden gnome are watching it below of the light, in a row.**

"Hey," you said, "Have you think about social distancing?"

"We don't becaue we don't need..." the gnome said, "Hey, but it sounds funny!"

Then they kept **at least 50px distance to other gnome**, but still kept no distance with the wall.

"Oh no, Santa will come here, we must hide. Can you put the **cover-classed element** to **cover us and the wall, but not outside of the wall?** Hurry!"

All of the gnomes grabbed and took your **20% transparent blue jacket**. You feel so cold, but the gnomes are surprisingly strong, so you cannot do other thing than help them.

"But you can play with me, so **clicking should be possible keeping the cover!**"
