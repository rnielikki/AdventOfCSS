# Day 17

Santa Claus calls you from his own room. There are so many decorations in the room, and of course, there is also the tree that you decorated. You feel satisfied.

"This tree, you made this? Looks beautiful, thank you."

Saying that words, Santa takes something below the desk. The box looks simple. It's **red box** with **light pink input field without border** on the top. The box is inside gray border.

"This is a special task", he said, "Because it's about security, which means, I trust you."

He gives you a password. **The password was `hunter2`**.

"This password... OK."

You feel so unsecured, but decided not to say anything about the password.

"So **if the password matches, this red box (cover) turns green and it reveals the content by sliding up.** And **it takes 0.2 seconds to open and close**."

You think about the 0.2 seconds, and suddnly **transition effect** comes to the mind. And the effect should work for only opening and closing, so nobody see the content while loading the box.

Santa is wearing glasses, staring on the precious box.

"All good, but the box looks small. Can you **resize the box width and height to 500px while the input is active?**"

You decided to use **transition** again, but **0.3 seconds** in this time.

...

After the work, you said to yourself, "But it's empty box. Where is the 'special task for security'?"
