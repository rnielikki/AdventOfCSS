# Day 18

Today is so nice and clean, there are no cloud on the sky. The outside from the window is empty. Really nothing is shown. You feel boring, but curious why.

'Maybe it's not the time', you think, 'Maybe I can wait until the sunlight is shown here, or I can move there'.

You moved the seat to left side. Now you can see **sun and snow from the window**. (Or you can see because *you drew on the window*)

The joyful time was so short. The sunlight is too strong, so you can't work anymore. You need curatin to cover the sunlight.

You found a **slider** to make, and choose **white** fabric that fits to room color. The handle is **circles**, which also looks beautiful.

**Also down arrow key moves the curtain down, and up arrow key moves the curtain up.**

'*I'll want this for both place, firefox and chrome*', you think, staring the curtain.

Use template from [here](contents/2020/html/day18.html) and edit only CSS.

## Rules

**Only use CSS 3+**. Editing template (both HTML and CSS) and using JavaScript are not allowed. Of course any image drawing outside CSS isn't allowed.

**Don't use !important.**

You can use stylesheet language that can converted into CSS (Sass, Less etc).
