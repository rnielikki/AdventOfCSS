# Day 19

Today nothing is shown. No gnomes, no Santa. You open doors and look around rooms to find them, but there was no use.

In a table, you found some **radio buttons** in a line. Santa is now coming to you. "These are also gnomes", Santa said. "Use magic to **turn them into gnomes**."

You are now thinking how they look like. They had **yellowgreen faces with a triangle hat**. You also aware of the buttons - what kind of labels they have. **Every name is on the value** and the **hat color is saved in --data-color**.

"I heard of the CSS, your tool, so I put the color there." Then the Santa says ho-ho-ho.

You put the **label with black background below the gnomes. Every gnome equally share the screen width peacefully, and they are centered inside their block**.

---

The gnomes started to discussing, who will be the leader. Leader is **selected by clicking**. The leader is **on the front side of their line**. **The leader's whole block background color is black**, while other has black background only in their label.
