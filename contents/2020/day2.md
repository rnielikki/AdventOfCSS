# Day 2

Thanks to the lining job, the gift moved very fast.

Now you need to pack the gifts by yourself.

There are some tasks on your table:

* **Box with every even number is brown.**
* **Number of every third box is invisible, but you can see the number by selecting.**

Use template from [here](contents/2020/html/day2.html) and edit only CSS.

## Result

![day2 result](contents/2020/images/day2.svg)

## Rules

**Only use CSS 3+**. Editing template (both HTML and CSS) and using JavaScript are not allowed. Of course any image drawing outside CSS isn't allowed.

**Don't use !important.**

You can use stylesheet language that can converted into CSS (Sass, Less etc).
