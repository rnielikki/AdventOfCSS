# Day 21

The nignt came to the Santa village. You are walking outside to refresh yourself.

The landscape was beautiful. **The background (*cover class*) have no uncomfortable pixel range to left and top side** (*to the browser*), so it just looked perfect. You took some pictures.

The **golden scroll bar is shining in the dark, telling the position**, but **the track has no color (transparent)**. (*hint: Don't mind the scroll left/right button*) The scroll didn't tell how much high you are (*no y scroll*).

There are some **gray houses**. You soon found that it's for the delivery simulaton.

You also found a **red sledge**, floating on the scroll. When you run the sledge, the scroll moved (So **when the scroll moves, the sledge also goes along**). You can visit the houses. with the sledge.

The sledge **stops automatically, aligning its left to the target house's left**. It looks like a magnet.
