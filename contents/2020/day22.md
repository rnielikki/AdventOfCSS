# Day 22

Looks like the task never ends. The are bunch of packages to deliver, and the room is filled of letters.

"Letters are relatively not so much. Package is delivered to everyone, but not everyone send letter.", a delivery gnome said.

Today you'll put them to envelope and fill them with the right format for letter envelope. Letter sending is done one or couple of days before gift delivering, so the task must be done today, before night comes to the village.

The right formet is : **sender is on the left top corner and receiver is on the right bottom corner**. **Receiver text is right-aligned**.

The *name is on the first line*, **with bold text and 2rem line height**.

Now you need to glue a stamp. More like **make a new stamp**, because you don't have any stamp neither glue.

**Stamp border is zig-zag shape, as `--post-image` defines**. Stamp contains a image, which has **gradient border** (image can be anything, even gradient is ok).
You glue on the envelope, now **the stamp has shadow**.

Use template from [here](contents/2020/html/day22.html) and edit only CSS.

## Rules

**Only use CSS 3+**. Editing template (both HTML and CSS) and using JavaScript are not allowed. Of course any image drawing outside CSS isn't allowed.

**Don't use !important.**

You can use stylesheet language that can converted into CSS (Sass, Less etc).
