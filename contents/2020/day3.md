# Day 3

Nice job. The boxes look beautiful, but we can make them more beautiful.

* **Boxes have star darkgreen decoration (&#x2736;) on the top center. (The character unicode is 10038 and 0x2736)**
* **Make the box order to D-C-B-A** without touching the content, but keep the row direction.

Use template from [here](contents/2020/html/day3.html) and edit only CSS.

## Result

## Rules

**Only use CSS 3+**. Editing template (both HTML and CSS) and using JavaScript are not allowed. Of course any image drawing outside CSS isn't allowed.

**Don't use !important.**

You can use stylesheet language that can converted into CSS (Sass, Less etc).
