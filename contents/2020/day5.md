# Day 5

While you packing the gifts inside, Santa Claus called you from outside: "Hey, help me with fixing the sledge!"

It looks like engineer gnomes are busy doing other tasks. So you decided to take the work.

And here is what you need to do:

First, **make 50px round the bottom left part of the sledge**.

Second, **Set sledge foot round - 50% to height, 15% to width**.

---

After the work, you found the some uncomfortable gaps from each part. The sledge body, legs and foot should be connected, but they didn't.

You decided to **connect them (remove the gaps)** and make engineer gnomes happy.

Use template from [here](contents/2020/html/day5.html) and edit only CSS.
