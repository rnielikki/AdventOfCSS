# Day 6

The gnomes didn't come to see your beautiful work. You found there are one task that the gnomes left. It was light bulbs for night delivery.

There are paper with the bulbs, saying "For reindeers. **75px, circle, 3px border, brown-edged** light bulb", but all you see are some checkboxes - maybe some filament for bulb.

You decided to make the bulb with these specs.

---

After making the bulbs, you found that these bulbs don't work anymore. You should **turn on and off the red light inside bulb, by clicking the bulb**.

You want to make it beautiful. So, when using the lightbulb, **nasty outline is removed**. But after removing, there is another problem - nobody can see which one is selected. So you decided to make the **selected lightbulb border to grey**.

Use template from [here](contents/2020/html/day6.html) and edit only CSS.

## Result

Grey is selected, red paint is turned on (checked).

## Rules

**Only use CSS 3+**. Editing template (both HTML and CSS) and using JavaScript are not allowed. Of course any image drawing outside CSS isn't allowed.

**Don't use !important.**

You can use stylesheet language that can converted into CSS (Sass, Less etc).
