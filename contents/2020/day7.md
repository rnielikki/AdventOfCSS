# Day 7

Your hands are freezing cold. Santa came back to see how it's going. He found you on the garage, making the light bulbs.

"What are you doing here? Ah, the light blubs. Good job, thank you. This work's priority was not so high, so the job was left undone. Well well, I didn't mean you did useless things, it should be done sometimes, anyway. Thank you."

He moved inside a room, filled with post boxes.

"Your job is presents and letters arranging, in the warm place." Now you are warm room, where is fireplace.

"**Throw the gifts that tagged as empty (data-tag=empty).**", Santa said, "And when you've done, **attach letters**."

The letter was **coral-colored** and **letter size is 80px**. They're attached in **just right side and bottom**.

Then, paint the **upside of gift with Orange, 10px**.

Use template from [here](contents/2020/html/day7.html) and edit only CSS.
