# Day 8

The letter attachment work ended. There are some glue on your fingers. Washing your hand, you think about what you should do. Maybe not the engineering things.

Then, the shelf came to your mind. There are some unsorted gift boxes inside the shelf. You think about the task, and it was:

* **Plush on the top right.**
* **Lego on the bottom right.**
* **Toy is 1 block up of Lego and horizontally center.**
* **Book is on the left, just below plush, but has 2 times width than others**.

Now you need to attach some tapes on the gifts.

The tape is **45 degree from horizon and on this way: /**

**Tape is also green and on the top left.** There are no specs about others, for example, how much pixel it is.

Use template from [here](contents/2020/html/day8.html) and edit only CSS.

## Result

## Rules

**Only use CSS 3+**. Editing template (both HTML and CSS) and using JavaScript are not allowed. Of course any image drawing outside CSS isn't allowed.

**Don't use !important.**

You can use stylesheet language that can converted into CSS (Sass, Less etc).
