# Day 9

When you've arrived to the room, you felt so cold. You checked the fireplace, and found that the fire was gone. There were no woods for fire, either.

You took saw and came outside to get some woods. You found some trees, but you must keep some of them. So, **cut down only tree without leaves (Rotate 90 deg)** and **move them up to 100px** so you can carry them. Remember that the **rotation center is left bottom** so trees are cut down properly.

After cutting down the tree, **take off the branches** so you can chop down them.

---

After cutting down the tree, **the leaves from tree, except after the trees you took, turned yellow**.

Use template from [here](contents/2020/html/day9.html) and edit only CSS.
